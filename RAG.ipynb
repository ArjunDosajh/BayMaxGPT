Be sure to follow directions carefully. Use a dedicated pumice stone, emery board, or nail file to remove dead skin from the wart the day after each application of wart remover. Don't use the file for any other purpose; it could spread the virus to another part of your body. Use duct tape like you would a wart-remover patch. Put a small strip over the wart and leave it in place for about six days. At the end of the sixth day, remove the tape, soak the wart in water and then gently debride it with a pumice stone, emery board, or nail file. Repeat the process as often as it takes to remove the wart. Yet another option is a freeze spray where liquid butane is sprayed directly onto the wart to freeze and kill the tissue. This is generally only effective on smaller warts because the spray cannot get as cold or as deep as the freezing treatments you would get in your doctor's office. It can also be fairly painful because the spray has to be applied to the wart directly for several seconds. You will likely develop a blister around the area.

You can offset the calcium lost from drinking one cup of coffee by adding just two tablespoons of milk. However, research does show links between caffeine and hip fracture risk in older adults.

A slight, temporary rise in heart rate and blood pressure is common in those who are sensitive to caffeine.

It can affect your whole body, not just your stomach. Symptoms may include: Rash, hives, or itchy skin Shortness of breath Chest pain Sudden drop in blood pressure, trouble swallowing or breathing -- this is life-threatening.

When you eat out, ask your server about how your meal will be prepared. It may not always be clear from the menu whether some dishes contain problem foods. Learn to read food labels and check the ingredients for trigger foods. Don't forget to check condiments and seasonings. They may have MSG or another additive that can cause symptoms.\\nHow will I be tested for food allergies?\\tFirst, he'll puts a small drop of liquid containing the food on your skin, and pricks it. Then he'll watch for a reaction -- a small bump that may get red like a mosquito bite. If your skin reacts, you're probably allergic to that food. Your doctor can talk with you about other treatment options. If you don't react, you're probably not allergic to it. This test is usually sent to a lab, and results could take a week or more. Your doctor will give you food samples and watch for a reaction.\\nHow can I know if I'm allergic to a food?\\tFirst, he'll ask you questions about what you think you're allergic to and your symptoms. Sometimes that's enough to pinpoint the problem food, or he may suggest some tests. Allergy testing can help your doctor find out what you're allergic to, but it's not foolproof. After your tests are done, you'll need to work with him to get the right diagnosis. To confirm a skin or blood test, or to see if a child has outgrown an allergy.\\nWhat happens in your body when you have a food allergy?\\tWhen you eat something you are allergic to, your body makes antibodies. Over time, sometimes as soon as the second time you eat it, the antibodies spring into action, starting a process that includes the release of lots of histamine to fight what it believes is invading your body. Histamine is a powerful chemical that can affect your respiratory system, digestive tract, skin, and heart and blood vessels.\""
